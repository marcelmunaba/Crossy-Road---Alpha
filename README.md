A simple Crossy Road game using Pygame! Many thanks to the UDEMY Course teaching game development using Pygame (Certificate URL : https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-2d0f107a-4f70-47ed-9a80-e098628de4de/).

Installation : 

Make sure pygame is installed - See official documentation of pygame on installing pygame.

Create a new Folder to install the game (ex. 'Crossy Road') in your desired directory.

Ignore the error message when exiting the game.

Enjoy :)
